# What Do Web Pages Do (WIP)
Sometime you need to know exactly what a webpage will be doing in terms of 
- Requests Made / Timing
- JavaScript Activity / Used
- HTML Information

In Order to Know How To Archive Them Or How Well They Were Archived.

Current Means Of Determining This Are Not Good Enough i.e Via An Archive Or By Hand 

Because Non High Fidelity Web Archiving Does Not Preserve Everything Or Ever Will

This Project Attempts To Provide A Comprehensive Means Of Obtaining That Information

### TODO(n0tan3rd): Generalize for public consumption
